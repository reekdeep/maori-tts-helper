// Note: This is a simplified version. In a real app, you would likely want to
// handle API calls to a translation service, error handling, and possibly
// more complex state management. This example focuses on the basic structure
// and functionality of a React app using Tailwind CSS for styling.
// Make sure to install Tailwind CSS and set it up in your project for the styles to work.
// You can follow the Tailwind CSS installation guide: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
// Also, consider adding a TTS library or API to handle the text-to-speech functionality.
// For TTS, you might use the Web Speech API or a service like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.
// For more advanced features, consider using a state management library like Redux or Context API,
// and possibly a routing library like React Router if you plan to expand the app.
// This code is a basic starting point for your Māori TTS helper app.
// It provides a simple input field for English phrases, a button to "translate" them,
// and displays a mock Māori response. You can expand this with actual translation logic,
// TTS functionality, and more complex UI components as needed.
// Remember to test your app thoroughly and ensure it meets the needs of your users.
// You can also consider adding features like:
// - Saving favorite phrases
// - History of translated phrases
// - User authentication for personalized experiences
// - Accessibility features for better usability
// - Responsive design for mobile users
// - Internationalization support if you plan to support multiple languages
// - Integration with a backend service for persistent storage
// - Error handling for network requests and user input validation
// - Unit tests and end-to-end tests for reliability
// - Documentation for users and developers
// - Deployment scripts for easy deployment to platforms like Vercel or Netlify
// - Analytics to track usage and improve the app over time
// This will help you create a robust and user-friendly application.
